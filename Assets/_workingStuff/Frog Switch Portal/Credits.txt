Wario Land 4: Frog Switch Portal

Model and all textures made from scratch by Peardian using Cinema 4D and Fireworks.


Info:
This is a 3D recreation of the portals in Wario Land 4 and the portal transition screen.
A mask mesh is provided for engines that can allow invisible polygons to hide the portal's true depth.
The base colors are picked directly from the game to make them as accurate as possible.
Both models use a mask texture to display two layers of scrolling color gradients on the same UVs.
For the tunnel, the black part of the mask is for Cycle1 and the white part is for Cycle2.
The scale of these Cycle textures can be raised to make the colors cycle more frequently.
For the portal, both colors come from the same Cycle texture, but with the horizontal scale set to 6400%.
However, the second layer (white part of the mask) should be offset to the right by 1/4th.
The portal colors cycle between red-yellow-green-blue, and the second layer should always be one step ahead of the first layer.
If this is too complicated to implement, animated color cycles can be used instead of the gradient textures.
