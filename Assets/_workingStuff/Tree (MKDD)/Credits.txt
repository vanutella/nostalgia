In Nintendo's Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, the trees have eyes.
This fan remake was made by Peaches Coughlan. Uses two color palettes, one from the GCN original and one based on the MKWii version of those trees (which sadly lacked eyes)
If used, please give credit and let me know so I can enjoy your creations too ^_^
